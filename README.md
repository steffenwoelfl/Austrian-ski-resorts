# Austrian-ski-resorts
A Project aimed at doing some webscraping in python to compromise data about Austrian ski resorts and provide some nice visuals.

The python code contains the following steps:
  1) Scraping data about all Austrian ski resorts from bergfex.at;
  2) Creating a pandas dataframe and cleaning the data;
  3) Conducting some basic descriptive statistics to summarize information about the ski resorts' altitudes, slopes, ratings, prices, and their relationships;
  4) Illustrating the key descriptives using matplotlib
