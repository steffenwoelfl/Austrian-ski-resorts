# Austrian-ski-resorts
A Project aimed at doing some webscraping in python to compromise data about Austrian ski resorts and provide some nice visuals.

The python code contains the following steps:
  Scraping data about all Austrian ski resorts from bergfex.at
  Creating a pandas dataframe and cleaning the data
  Conduct some basic descriptive statistics to summarize information about the ski resorts' altitudes, slopes, ratings, prices, and their relationships
